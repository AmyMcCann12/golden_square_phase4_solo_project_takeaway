## 1. Describe the problem:

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

## Use the twilio-python package to implement this next one. You will need to use mocks too.

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.

## Fair warning: if you push your Twilio API Key to a public GitHub repository, anyone will be able to see and use it. What are the security implications of that? How will you keep that information out of your repository?

## 2. Design the Class System
